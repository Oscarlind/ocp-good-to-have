# Configuration
When configuring a LDAP/AD identity provider there are a few configuration parameters that are good to understand. I will be going through them below. The full example file can be found under: 
* **templates/oauth.yaml**
* **templates/groupSync.yaml**

## The oauth configuration
In the Oauth configuration we specify a list of identity providers and how authentication from the cluster to the identity provider is happening but also how user access to the cluster should look like

```yaml
bindDN: cn=ldap-service-account,ou=ServiceAccounts,dc=mycompany,dc=com
bindPassword:
  name: ldap-secret
ca:
  name: ldap-ca-config-map

```
This configuration is how we select the service account in our LDAP/AD that we are going to use for the authentication to the LDAP/AD server itself. It also specifies where the password for the SA is located and any certificates needed to perform a secure connection.

### Limiting authentication with a proper URL
```yaml
      url: ldaps://ldap.example.com:636/dc=mycompany,dc=com?sAMAccountName?sub?(&(objectClass=user)(|(memberof=CN=ocp-admins,OU=Groups,OU=Departments,DC=mycompany,DC=com)(memberof=CN=dev-team01,OU=Groups,OU=Departments,DC=mycompany,DC=com)(memberof=CN=dev-team02,OU=Groups,OU=Departments,DC=mycompany,DC=com)(memberof=CN=platform-support,OU=Groups,OU=Departments,DC=mycompany,DC=com)))
      mappingMethod: claim
      name: AD
      type: LDAP
```
* **url:** The URL to the LDAP/AD server. This URL includes a list of specific groups, allowing only members of these groups to authenticate to the cluster.
* **mappingMethod:** Controls how mappings are established between this providerâ€™s identities and User objects.
* **name:** The name of the identity provider (IDP). This name is displayed when logging into OpenShift via the GUI.
* **type:** The type of identity provider, indicating that LDAP is used for authentication.

In this example we are specyfing a few different things. First is the URL to the LDAP/AD server itself. This URL includes a list of a four (4) different specific groups. namely: 
* **ocp-admins** 
* **dev-team01** 
* **dev-team02** 
* **platform-support**

This means that only members of these four groups will be able to authenticate to the cluster. This is a good way of limiting access to the cluster itself.

## The group sync
In order to pull in groups from our Active Directory or LDAP server we can use the [group-sync operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/group-sync-operator)

Using the operator we can perform group sync against multiple different identity providers. In this example we will be using it against an Active Directory.

### Querying

```yaml
rfc2307:
  groupsQuery:
    baseDN: OU=Groups,OU=Departments,DC=mycompany,DC=com
    # The baseDN specifies WHERE in the AD structure we are looking for groups.
    derefAliases: never
    filter: (objectClass=groupofnames)
    scope: sub

# For LDAP/AD User Queries
  usersQuery:
    baseDN: DC=mycompany,DC=com
    # Here in the userQuery, we are selecting the root of the AD domain.
    derefAliases: never
    pageSize: 0
    scope: sub
```
### Whitelisting
```yaml
url: ldaps://ldap.example.com:636
whitelist:
- CN=ocp-admins
- CN=dev-team01
- CN=dev-team02
- CN=platform-support
# The whitelist specifies the exact groups that are allowed access to the cluster.
```
We also specify the URL for the server, which we are keeping to the base url. Then we are using the **whitelist** field to specify the exact groups that we are pulling into the cluster. As you can see it is matching the groups that we also allow to authenticate with the cluster.

With using both a restrictive setup for the URL in the OAuth configuration, combined with a whitelist approach to the group synchronization, we can set up our cluster in a way that only required users and groups are allowed access to it.
